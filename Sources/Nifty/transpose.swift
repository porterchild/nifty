// TODO: transpose only operates on double matrices... extend to int, float, string, etc.
// It's specific to doubles because of the use of BLAS function. Can use BLAS on ints/floats, but
// for strings or Any we'll have to do something custom (which will be slower).

// TODO: there must be a faster way to transpose... 
// LAPACKE states that it transposes row-major matrices on input (since fortran is column-major), 
// and that seems to barely be noticeable in inverting large (5000x5000) matrices (both row and 
// column take around 6 seconds). But just transposing the way it's done below takes around 4 
// seconds (still better than the 8 seconds a naive double for loop takes).

// TODO: decide on operator, add it to documentation. Maybe A^ to transpose? A* should be conjugate.
// A~ maybe. A` is invalid I believe. Maybe unicode symbols? Aáµ€
